public ip 
is not associated with an aws account
no charge for the public ip
when instance re launched it changes

elastic ip
it is associated with aws account
charges are applied
it is the same until manually release

****************EBS ELASTIC BLOCK STORAGE
EC2 is directly connected to EBS
while instance is running a volatile memory called ephemeral storage will be attached to the instance
if the instance is stopped the ephemeral memory will be detached

****************EBS CONCEPTS
THROUGHPUT=sequential transfer rate that an ssd or hdd will maintain continuously ****  ****   ****
IOPS=measure of the number of I/O opeartions a drive can handle per second wich each block being read from or written to a ramdom location in the disk
iops 100 means every second 
your EBS write 50 read 50 operations
or write 30 and read 70 operations

**************volume type of EBS volume

                                         size limit             max iops                max throughput          max burst

we can now enable multi-attache on amazon ebs provisioned iops io1 volumes to allow a single volume to be concurrently attached to up to 16 AWS nitro system-based
amazon EC2 instances within the same availability zone.

without multi-attach for each EC2 (1) --> EBS(1)     EC2 (2) --> EBS(2)   EC2 (3) --> EBS(3)
BUT with multi-attach EC2 (1)  EC2 (2)  EC2 (3)  ----> Single EBS you pay less

**********************************SNAPSHOT = backup
snapshot are used to backup data on EBS volumes
all snapshot are incremental backups except for the first one
snapshot are copied to amazon S3

A B C --->  1st snapshot   A B C
A B C D ---> 2nd snapshot  D

*******************************Ebs encryption        INSTANCE-SNAPSHOT-EBS

+SUPPORTED BY ALL VOLUMES BUT NOT ALL INSTANCES
HELLO <----> :"? ---SNAPSHOT--->:"?

+UNENCRYPTED TO ENCRYPTED
HELLO---->HELLO-----copy and encrypt--> :"?---->:"?

+ENCRYPTED TO UNENCRYPTED

******************************CREATE /MOUNT EBS VOLUME
sudo su //name of file system = xvdf

lsblk

file -s /dev/xvdf

mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf

mkdir ebsvolume

mount /dev/xvdf ebsvolume

lsblk //to check if it is mount

df -h

umount /dev/xvdf

//after you resize from the console do this to see the change
resize2fs

**********************************EFS elastic file system
benefits:
highly available, elastic , high performance, shared file system
mounting efs into ec2

create efs into aws  and click on attach 
++++++++++++++++++++++++
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install nfs-common
mkdir efs
+++++++++++++++++++++++
df -h
umount efs
copy cmd from aws and paste
*************************************Reserved / spots instances

DEDICATED   you have your own hardware , you dont share 

RESERVED   for you only,

SPOT  unused ec2,terminate if price increase than the bid price
