Devops Goals are

High availability
Security
Scalable
Logging
Monitoring
Automation
Fast delivery

Developer 1-develop the software product
           DEVOPS ENGINEER (SCRUM CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION AND CONTINUOUS DEPLOYMENBT)
Operations 1-deploy the software product 2-maintain the servers

Agile Development
1-develops functionality1
2-integrate and test
3-develop functionality2
4-integrate and test
----
5-develop functionality N
6-integrate and test

DEMO RELLEASE

client feedback
make changes
system testing
all functionalitues complete?
yes good
No go back to the beginning

LINUX = install and conf devops tools
AWS = infractructure solution
GIT = version control system
BITBUCKET = distributed control system
MAVEN= build java source code
JFrog ARTIFACTORY = STORE ARTIFACT
SONARQUBE = quality check
ANSIBLE = configuration automation
NGINX = reverse proxy server
DOCKER = manage containerized applications
GRAFANA = monitor applications
JENKINS = ci/cd for continuous intgration and continuous deployment
PYTHON = automate certain devops responsabilities
TERRAFORM = infrastructure deployment
MYSQL = database solution to store the data
JIRA = to follow the scrum process to make the technologies are integrated snd deployed by following certain process while delivering the services
KIBANA = monitor the logging of the applications at a central place
HELM = for the deployment tool it into the kubernetes cluster fluency for logging the applications logs
PROMETHEUS = for monitoring 
KUBERNETES = deploy your workload and run the workload s a microservices

all this tools help to follow the continuous integration and continuous deployment
to help develop team and handling over the workload to the operations teams

what is devops?
culture of integrating multiples tools which will helping the business to meet the business expectations
1-continuous development (git/bitbucket)
2-infrastructure as a code(terraform, linux, aws , mysql)
3-configuration automation(ansible, python)
4-continuous orchestration (kubernetes , docker)
5-continuous delivery (jenkins , helm)
6-continuous integration (jfrog artifactory, maven , sonarqube)
7-continuous operations (aws . kubernetes)
8-continuous logging (kibana, elasticsearch, fluentd)
9-continuous monitoring(Grafana, Prometheus)
